# Halloween
Website for code first girls Halloween project

Home page: (index.html ) This page is responsive 
we have used bootstrap to create the drop down menus and the carousel of pictures and the layout for the cards 
We used Javascritp to do a countdown to halloween which updates

The following pages are all the same in layout just the content differs to keep the site flowing well 
recipes.html (not responsive) 
decoration.html (not responsive) 
carving.html(not responsive) 

other files 
css/style.css
js/app.js

TODO: 
the recipe, caeving and decoration pages all still need to be made responsive

What went well. 



What was more difficult
